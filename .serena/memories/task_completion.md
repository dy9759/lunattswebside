âœ… COMPLETED: MainVoiceDisplay component layout fix

**Successfully implemented:**
1. Icon positioned on same line as "Storyteller" text using flexbox layout (alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center')
2. Description text aligned to bottom-left using alignSelf: 'flex-end' and textAlign: 'left'  
3. Replaced unclear arrow icons with user-provided SVG icon
4. Fixed all TypeScript/JSX syntax errors that were causing compilation failures
5. Component now renders successfully with HTTP 200 responses

**Technical details:**
- Cleaned up malformed JSX syntax and CSS object properties
- Maintained responsive design and hover effects
- Preserved Material-UI styling patterns
- Ensured proper TypeScript interface definitions
